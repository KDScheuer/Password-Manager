# Password-Manager
Python Password Manager with GUI
Uses SHA 512 for Master Password and AES Encryption of App Username and Password

On first run the password manager will prompt for a Master Password. This password
will be used to access the program on future start ups. The program also generates 
a key that it uses to encrypt all usernames and passwords for the entered programs.
